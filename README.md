## Community Guidelines

Our mission is to foster transparency and unity by documenting real experiences—whether exposing injustice or showcasing support. To keep our community safe and impactful, follow these rules:

1. **Film in Public Spaces Only**:
   - Record in public areas (e.g., stores, streets) with no privacy expectation.
   - Do not upload videos from private settings or that expose personal details (e.g., addresses).

2. **Share Authentic Experiences**:
   - Document discrimination (e.g., unfair treatment based on race or religion) or positive acts (e.g., cross-community support).
   - Videos must be unedited, up to 5 minutes, and authentic—not staged or misleading.

3. **Respect Legal Boundaries**:
   - Comply with local laws on filming and audio recording (e.g., consent where required).
   - Do not upload copyrighted material unless you have permission.

4. **Prohibited Content**:
   - Hate speech, threats, or harassment, **except when documenting discrimination to expose it**.
   - Nudity, graphic violence, or illegal activities.
   - False or defamatory content aimed at harming others.

5. **Promote Safety and Respect**:
   - Use the app to inform and uplift, not to bully or harass.
   - Respect all users’ right to share their stories.

6. **Enforcement**:
   - Violations may result in content removal, account suspension, or banning.
